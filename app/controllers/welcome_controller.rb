class WelcomeController < ApplicationController

  # Here's the description of the requirements:
  # 1. On the main home page, the user can enter a space-separated string to be used as the input (e.g. "A B C D")
  # 2. The platform should output the transformed version of the input string
  # 3. The lookup table should be implemented in a database (Postgres)
  # 4. The app should be deployable to Heroku (you can get a free account if you don't have one)

  def index

  def transform
    input = params[:input]
    # transform
    @output = input.split(" ")
    render :index
  end
